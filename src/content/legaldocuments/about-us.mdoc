## **Our Story**

Veloxy CareRide was founded on the principles of empathy, compassion, and dedication to serving others. Our founder, Reginald Ford, recognized the challenges faced by seniors and cancer patients in getting to their medical appointments, social events, and daily errands. He saw the impact that Non-Emergency Medical transportation barriers can have on a person's quality of life and well-being, and he knew he had to do something about it.

With a deep understanding of the importance of timely and reliable transportation, Reginald set out to create a solution that would meet the unique needs of this community. He assembled a team of experienced professionals with expertise in transportation management, healthcare, and customer service, and together they developed a comprehensive transportation program that prioritizes the comfort, safety, and well-being of every rider.
