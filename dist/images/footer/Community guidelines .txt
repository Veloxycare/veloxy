We take threats of suicide and self-harm seriously and may reach out to authorities to request a wellness check if we receive notification that there is an imminent risk of self-harm. For public emergencies, Veloxy may take additional measures to try to preserve the safety of our platform, including but not limited to natural disasters, public health emergencies, and public crisis situations.
